    "description":"The Shahnama is the longest epic poem in the world and was written by Firdawsi around 1012. It contains the history of the ancient Persian kings, and the knowledge of the earliest kings of Iran was transmitted in literary form mainly through the Shahnama. The main character of this story is Manuchihr. He was the grandson of Iraj, and Fereydun was his great-grandfather. After Iraj was killed, Fereydun crowned Manuchihr as king. And after Fereydun's death, Manuchihr was devastated.\n\nManuchihr and his subjects mourned the death of Fereydun for seven days. On the eighth day, Manuchihr came out, put the king's crown back on his head, ascended the throne, and made a speech. In his speech, he mainly described his role as a leader and the role of love and justice, anger and strife. Under his leadership, he punished many evil people. Despite this, he explained that he still belongs to God, and all his followers should likewise belong to God. Anyone who goes against the will of God is an infidel. According to Manuchihr, we need to forbid and punish such people. And he will certainly punish the murderers who betrayed his grandparents."},

    "description":"For Islamic and Persian cultures, colour has always played a symbolic role in religion, poetry, and everyday life (Encyclopaedia Iranica, 2011). Unlike the large bright colours worn, Manuchihr's outfit was understated but luxurious. On his head, Manuchihr wore a ruby-studded king's hat. His long orange sleeves were covered with a navy-blue v-neck blouse with gold floral accents on the chest and shoulders. The pants were the same dark blue as the top smock, with two circles of gold floral patterns on each calf of the pants. The ankle closure is also wrapped in gold coils, revealing orange socks that echo the long sleeves of the upper body. Dark blue, however, is the colour of mourning and asceticism in Persian culture, which corresponds to the theme of mourning depicted in the image (Encyclopaedia Iranica, 2011).\n\nA crimson blanket ornamented with gold lays beneath him, and a sheet of orange silk embellished with golden stars drapes naturally from beneath the golden throne. In Persian culture, red carries all the power of blood and energy (Encyclopaedia Iranica, 2011). As can be seen, the colours yellow, gold, and red are used extensively on Manuchihr's throne to symbolize the status of the king. The large cold color of Manuchihr's clothes also reflects his grieving mood. He is holding a white handkerchief in his hand, perhaps just now still crying with grief over the departure of Fereydun.\n\nWhen we look closely at his facial demeanour, we see that his mouth is tightly closed, and his eyes are slightly swollen, still unable to hide his sadness. But otherwise, his gaze is still firm. He is the leader of a nation, and he has to lead his subjects to rise and avenge his grandfathers' deaths."},

    "description":"From the translation of Arthur Warner, Manuchihr said, “I sit atop the revolving sphere, administering love, justice, wrath, and struggle. Earth is my servant, heaven my ally, kings' skulls my prey. Faith and Grace are mine to bless and damage. I take revenge at night; I'm Barzin's raging fire and lord of scimitar and golden boot. I raise Kawa's flag, illuminate the clouds, and fight without mercy. When I eat, my hands become an ocean, but when I ride, my breath is fire. I cut the wicked's practice short and make the land a scarlet brocade of blood. I wield the mace, illustrate the crown, and light the realm from my ivory seat. Let all our talk be about God, whose crown, throne, and host we hold. We laud and defend him. We follow blessed Fereydun. We're young compared to our grandfather. Whoever in the seven climes of earth departs from the way, abandons the Faith, injures mendicants, oppresses kin, lifts his head in money pride, or causes pain to the suffering, I consider them unbelievers. Worse than Ahriman. All evildoers who don't believe are forbidden by God and us; we'll use a scimitar to destroy their kingdom in revenge. All the world's great men blessed him and said, 'Thy beautiful grandsire, O benevolent Shah! Teach the throne and crown. Be your throne of powerful men, crown and archimages' grace. Our souls are dedicated to thee” (Firdawsi and Warner, 238)."},

    "description":"In front of Manuchihr are two subjects who cross their arms in front of their bodies and lean slightly forward, revealing their loyalty to Manuchihr. The subject on the left wears a round white turban and a long purple robe. The left front flap of the upper body covers the right side, with a golden accent on the chest. A black sash embellished by golden dots is tied around the waist. The lower part of the robe was also embellished with a circle of golden patterns, just like rice ears. The soles of his feet were covered with a pair of white boots. The man on the right looks higher in status than the man on the left. On his head he wears a pointed round hat with a golden decoration at the top. Unlike the dull purple color, his robe is yellow. The top half of the robe is a short-sleeved smock, revealing the long red sleeves inside. The boots on his feet are the same color as his sleeves, which are red. According to Arthur Warner's translation, the one wearing the yellow robe should be Sam, the chief of paladins. He said to Manuchihr that he was aware of Manuchihr's contribution to his country and hoped that God would bless Manuchihr. The rest of the war would be left to him and his subjects, who would do everything to protect Manuchihr."},

    "description":"A wide expanse of green grass can be seen in the backdrop, appearing almost like a wave as it moves with the breeze. There are a few different kinds of plants and flowers growing on the grass. A dark-colored soil at the bottom supports the growth of a dark-green shrub that is rather tall and has purple blossoms. Red flowers are also growing in a shorter spot in the lower right-hand corner of the image. Alongside Manuchihr, clusters of white hibiscus blossoms are opening up to reveal their beauty. The hibiscus flower, which stands for resiliency and energy, is also a representation of Manuchihr's resolve. There is a blue river portrayed in the top left corner of the photo, and there are still some red flowers blooming on the banks of the river. The power that Manuchihr brings to the position of leader is demonstrated by the fact that the wind that is blowing over the river looks like a crimson flame and is as intense and ferocious as a flame."},

    "description":"Let's begin by examining the calligraphy that is located at the very top of the image. From a linguistic standpoint, the Shahnama's language is Persian. Some individuals who have exceptional linguistic tastes think that Persian is the most elegant, beautiful, and humorous language that exists anywhere in the world (Casari 2013, 127). It is clear that the letters in these calligraphies have been given the appropriate amount of 'boldness' or 'faintness' depending on the context, as well as the appropriate shape. To achieve boldness, you must press the entire tip of the nib as firmly as you can onto the paper. Boldness is required in the middle and end parts of elongations, in the middle parts of semicircular final flourishes, and on the tops of dāl, fā, qāf, wāw, etc. By using the corner of the nib or a portion of its tip, you can achieve a more delicate line. It is necessary in the beginnings and the middles of the majority of letters, as well as in the endings of certain letters, which should be made thinner (Encyclopaedia Iranica, 2011). We can also see that Persian calligraphy places a lot of importance on the proportions of the letters and the composition of the writing in order to make the whole thing look more beautiful and balanced."},

    "description":"Let's take another look at the illustration, this time from the perspective of iconography. The composition is stepped from the bottom left to the top right, with Manuchihr's subjects located in the lowest part of the picture, Manuchihr sitting higher. The image also contains the key elements specified by Firdawsi. The guards standing behind Manuchihr are positioned in the highest position, which implies the guardianship of the king. Manuchihr can be identified by his crown and costume, while ordinary subjects and chiefs can also be distinguished by their hats and costumes. The common round turban is representative of a lesser social position, whereas the pointed round hat is indicative of a better social status. The robes that the characters are wearing as well as the patterns that are on their clothes also serve to reflect the time period. These dress standards and designs were common in Persia throughout the eleventh century. When it comes to the selection of colours, the overall tone of the picture is soothing, with huge sections of pale green lending a sense of composure to the image. However, the utilization of a variety of brilliant hues over Manuchihr's physique draws more attention to him than it would otherwise."},
