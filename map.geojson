    "description":"The Shahnama is the longest epic poem in the world and was written by Firdawsi around 1012, commissioned by the three bibliophilic sons of ShƒÅh Rukh. It contains the history of the ancient Persian kings, and the knowledge of the earliest kings of Iran was transmitted in literary form mainly through the Shahnama. The main character of this story is Manuchihr, who was the ruler of the Ziyarids (1012 at the latest - c. 1031). He was the grandson of Iraj, and Fereydun was his great-grandfather. After Iraj was killed, Fereydun crowned Manuchihr as king. And after Fereydun's death, Manuchihr was devastated. This story tells that Manuchihr was re-ascended to the throne and made a speech. Before that, Manuchihr and his subjects mourned the death of Fereydun for seven days. On the eighth day, Manuchihr came out, put the king's hat back on his head, ascended the throne, and made a speech. In his speech, he mainly delivered his role as a leader playing the role of love and justice, anger and strife. And under his leadership, he punished many evil people. But despite this, he still belongs to God, and all his followers should likewise belong to God. Anyone who goes against the will of God is an infidel. We need to forbid and punish such people. And he will certainly punish the murderers who betrayed his grandparents."},

    "description":"Unlike the large bright colors worn, Manuchihr's outfit was understated but luxurious. On his head, Manuchihr wore a ruby-studded king's hat. His long orange sleeves were covered with a navy-blue v-neck blouse with gold floral accents on the chest and shoulders. The pants were the same dark blue as the top smock, with two circles of gold floral patterns on each calf of the pants. The ankle closure is also wrapped in gold coils, revealing orange socks that echo the long sleeves of the upper body./n/n A crimson blanket ornamented with gold lays beneath him, and a sheet of orange silk embellished with golden stars drapes naturally from beneath the golden throne. As can be seen, the colors yellow, gold, and red, which represent power, are used extensively on Manuchihr's throne to symbolize the status of the king. The large cold color of Manuchihr's clothes also represents his grieving mood. He is holding a white handkerchief in his hand, perhaps just now still crying with grief over the departure of Fereydun. /n/n When we zoom in on his facial demeanour, we see that his mouth is tightly closed, and his eyes are slightly swollen, still unable to hide his sadness. But otherwise, his gaze is still firm. He was the leader of a nation, and he had to lead his subjects to rise and avenge his grandfathers' deaths.

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
