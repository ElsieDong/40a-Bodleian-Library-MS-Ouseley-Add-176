    "description":"The Shahnama is the longest epic poem in the world and was written by Firdawsi around 1012, commissioned by the three bibliophilic sons of Shāh Rukh. It contains the history of the ancient Persian kings, and the knowledge of the earliest kings of Iran was transmitted in literary form mainly through the Shahnama. The main character of this story is Manuchihr, who was the ruler of the Ziyarids (1012 at the latest - c. 1031). He was the grandson of Iraj, and Fereydun was his great-grandfather. After Iraj was killed, Fereydun crowned Manuchihr as king. And after Fereydun's death, Manuchihr was devastated. This story tells that Manuchihr was re-ascended to the throne and made a speech. Before that, Manuchihr and his subjects mourned the death of Fereydun for seven days. On the eighth day, Manuchihr came out, put the king's hat back on his head, ascended the throne, and made a speech. In his speech, he mainly delivered his role as a leader playing the role of love and justice, anger and strife. And under his leadership, he punished many evil people. But despite this, he still belongs to God, and all his followers should likewise belong to God. Anyone who goes against the will of God is an infidel. We need to forbid and punish such people. And he will certainly punish the murderers who betrayed his grandparents."},

    "description":"Unlike the large bright colors worn, Manuchihr's outfit was understated but luxurious. On his head, Manuchihr wore a ruby-studded king's hat. His long orange sleeves were covered with a navy-blue v-neck blouse with gold floral accents on the chest and shoulders. The pants were the same dark blue as the top smock, with two circles of gold floral patterns on each calf of the pants. The ankle closure is also wrapped in gold coils, revealing orange socks that echo the long sleeves of the upper body.\n\nA crimson blanket ornamented with gold lays beneath him, and a sheet of orange silk embellished with golden stars drapes naturally from beneath the golden throne. As can be seen, the colors yellow, gold, and red, which represent power, are used extensively on Manuchihr's throne to symbolize the status of the king. The large cold color of Manuchihr's clothes also represents his grieving mood. He is holding a white handkerchief in his hand, perhaps just now still crying with grief over the departure of Fereydun.\n\nWhen we zoom in on his facial demeanour, we see that his mouth is tightly closed, and his eyes are slightly swollen, still unable to hide his sadness. But otherwise, his gaze is still firm. He was the leader of a nation, and he had to lead his subjects to rise and avenge his grandfathers' deaths."},

    "description":"From the translation of Arthur Warner, Manuchihr said, “I sit atop the revolving sphere, administering love, justice, wrath, and struggle. Earth is my servant, heaven my ally, kings' skulls my prey. Faith and Grace are mine to bless and damage. I take revenge at night; I'm Barzin's raging fire and lord of scimitar and golden boot. I raise Kawa's flag, illuminate the clouds, and fight without mercy. When I eat, my hands become an ocean, but when I ride, my breath is fire. I cut the wicked's practice short and make the land a scarlet brocade of blood. I wield the mace, illustrate the crown, and light the realm from my ivory seat. Let all our talk be about God, whose crown, throne, and host we hold. We laud and defend him. We follow blessed Fereydun. We're young compared to our grandfather. Whoever in the seven climes of earth departs from the way, abandons the Faith, injures mendicants, oppresses kin, lifts his head in money pride, or causes pain to the suffering, I consider them unbelievers. Worse than Ahriman. All evildoers who don't believe are forbidden by God and us; we'll use a scimitar to destroy their kingdom in revenge. All the world's great men blessed him and said, 'Thy beautiful grandsire, O benevolent Shah! Teach the throne and crown. Be your throne of powerful men, crown and archimages' grace. Our souls are dedicated to thee.”"},

    "description":"In front of Manuchihr are two subjects who cross their arms in front of their bodies and lean slightly forward, revealing their loyalty to Manuchihr. The subject on the left wears a round white turban and a long purple robe. The left front flap of the upper body covers the right side, with a golden accent on the chest. A black sash embellished by golden dots is tied around the waist. The lower part of the robe was also embellished with a circle of golden patterns, just like rice ears. The soles of his feet were covered with a pair of white boots. The man on the right looks higher in status than the man on the left. On his head he wears a pointed round hat with a golden decoration at the top. Unlike the dull purple color, his robe is yellow. The top half of the robe is a short-sleeved smock, revealing the long red sleeves inside. The boots on his feet are the same color as his sleeves, which are red. According to Arthur Warner's translation, the one wearing the yellow robe should be the thereat rose Sam, the chief of paladins. He said to Manuchihr that he was aware of Manuchihr's contribution to his country and hoped that God would bless Manuchihr. The rest of the war would be left to him and his subjects, who would do everything to protect Manuchihr."},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
